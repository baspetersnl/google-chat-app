# Google Chat for macOS

A native macOS app (Swift, AppKit and WKWebView) for Google Chat, as a replacement for the Chrome extension.

The app follows the language of your Mac: English by default, Dutch when macOS is set to Dutch.

## Installation

Download the latest zip from [Releases](https://github.com/baspetersnl/google-chat-app/releases), unzip it
and drag **Google Chat.app** to your Applications folder. The app is not notarized by Apple. If macOS says
the app cannot be opened, go to System Settings > Privacy & Security and click **Open Anyway**, or run:

```sh
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "/Applications/Google Chat.app"
```

Requires macOS 14 or later.

## Building

You only need the Command Line Tools, not Xcode.

```sh
./scripts/build.sh           # builds build/Google Chat.app
./scripts/build.sh install   # builds and copies it to /Applications
```

## Creating a release

1. Increase `CFBundleShortVersionString` (and `CFBundleVersion`) in `Support/Info.plist` and commit it.
2. Run `./scripts/release.sh`. The script builds the app, creates `build/Google-Chat-<version>.zip`,
   creates the tag `v<version>` and pushes it. With the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com) (`gh`), the
   release is published as well; otherwise the script shows the link to publish it yourself.

## Features

- **Notifications**: WKWebView does not support the Web Notification API. `NotificationShim` replaces
  `window.Notification` (and `showNotification` of service workers) and forwards every notification to
  `NotificationBridge`, which shows it in the macOS Notification Center with the sender's avatar.
  Clicking a notification brings the app to the front and opens the right conversation.
- **Runs in the background**: Cmd+W only hides the window. App Nap and the throttling of hidden pages
  are disabled, so messages keep coming in. Quit with Cmd+Q.
- **Dock badge** with the number of unread messages, read from the Home shortcut in Chat. When there is
  no number but the favicon shows a dot, the badge shows a dot.
- **Conversation stays at the bottom after sending**: in WebKit, a conversation shifts to the
  second-to-last message after sending. `ScrollShim` keeps it at the bottom.
- **Links** outside Chat (Drive, Meet, websites) open in your default browser.
- **Attachments** can be uploaded through the file dialog and are downloaded to `~/Downloads`.
- Your sign-in, zoom level (Cmd+ / Cmd- / Cmd0) and window position are remembered.
- **Localized**: menus, buttons and permission prompts follow the system language (English and Dutch).
  Translations live in `Support/<language>.lproj/`.

## Testing and debugging

The web view can be inspected: Safari > Develop > Google Chat. A test notification from the console:

```js
new Notification('Test', { body: 'Hello from Google Chat' })
```

If nothing appears, check System Settings > Notifications > Google Chat, and in Chat itself
(Settings > Notifications) whether browser notifications are enabled.

The unread count is read from Chat's labels in English and Dutch. In other languages the badge falls
back to a dot.
